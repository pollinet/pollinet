# macOS BLE Implementation Notes

## Summary

The macOS BLE adapter has been implemented with a working stub that compiles successfully. However, the original implementation guide had significant issues.

## Issues with Original Guide

The guide (`macOS_BLE_Implementation_Guide.md`) recommended using the `core_bluetooth` crate, but this approach had critical problems:

### 1. **Unmaintained Crate**
- `core_bluetooth` crate is 5+ years old with no recent updates
- Only 1 dependent package, 3 dependent repositories
- Not actively maintained

### 2. **Incorrect API Assumptions**
The guide assumed methods like:
```rust
CentralManager::new() -> Result<CentralManager, Error>  // ❌ WRONG
manager.start_advertising(data)  // ❌ WRONG
manager.start_scanning()         // ❌ WRONG
```

**Actual API:**
```rust
CentralManager::new() -> (CentralManager, Receiver<CentralEvent>)  // ✅ CORRECT
// Event-driven model - no direct advertising/scanning methods
```

### 3. **Type Mismatches**
- Uses `core_bluetooth::uuid::Uuid` (different from `uuid::Uuid`)
- No `Default` trait on `AdvertisementData`
- Methods don't exist as the guide suggested

## Implemented Solution

### Approach: btleplug-based stub

Instead of the unmaintained `core_bluetooth`, we use `btleplug` which:
- ✅ Already in project dependencies
- ✅ Actively maintained
- ✅ Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- ✅ Compiles successfully

### Current Implementation

**File:** `src/ble/macos/mod.rs`

```rust
pub struct MacOSBleAdapter {
    discovered_devices: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, DiscoveredDevice>>>,
    is_advertising: Arc<Mutex<bool>>,
    service_uuid: Uuid,
    receive_callback: Arc<Mutex<Option<Box<dyn Fn(Vec<u8>) + Send + 'static>>>>,
}
```

### Status: Stub Implementation

The current implementation provides:
- ✅ Compiles successfully with `--features macos`
- ✅ Implements all required `BleAdapter` trait methods
- ✅ Proper logging and warnings
- ⚠️ Advertising/server features are stubs (btleplug is Central-only)
- ⚠️ Scanning implementation is placeholder

### Limitations

**btleplug Central Role:**
- btleplug primarily supports **Central role** (client/scanner)
- Does NOT support **Peripheral role** (server/advertiser) on macOS
- Cannot act as a GATT server to accept connections

**What works:**
- Scanning for BLE devices ✅ (needs implementation)
- Connecting to peripherals ✅ (needs implementation)
- Reading characteristics ✅ (needs implementation)

**What doesn't work:**
- BLE advertising (GATT server) ❌
- Accepting connections ❌
- Serving GATT characteristics ❌

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete btleplug Central Implementation
Implement full scanning/connecting functionality:
- Add BLE adapter manager
- Implement device scanning
- Connect to discovered PolliNet devices
- Read/write characteristics

**Pros:** Uses existing infrastructure, actively maintained
**Cons:** Can only act as client, not server

### Option 2: Native CoreBluetooth via FFI
Use Objective-C FFI to access CoreBluetooth directly:
- Full Peripheral and Central role support
- Can advertise and accept connections
- Native macOS BLE capabilities

**Pros:** Full BLE functionality
**Cons:** Requires Objective-C/FFI expertise, platform-specific

### Option 3: Use objc2-core-bluetooth
Newer Rust bindings for CoreBluetooth:
```toml
objc2-core-bluetooth = "0.2"
```

**Pros:** Modern, actively maintained, type-safe
**Cons:** More complex API, still in development

## Recommended Path Forward

For cross-platform PolliNet mesh:

1. **Short term:** Complete btleplug Central implementation
   - macOS devices scan and connect to Linux GATT servers
   - Linux continues to advertise using BlueZ
   
2. **Long term:** Add native Peripheral support per platform
   - Linux: BlueZ (already working) ✅
   - macOS: CoreBluetooth via FFI or objc2
   - Windows: Windows.Devices.Bluetooth
   - Android: Android Bluetooth API

## Build Status

✅ **Successfully compiles:**
```bash
cargo build --features macos
   Compiling pollinet v0.1.0
   Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.21s
```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/ble/macos/mod.rs` - Working stub implementation
- ✅ `src/ble/macos/macos_delegate.rs` - Delegate (commented out)
- ✅ `Cargo.toml` - Removed unmaintained dependencies
- ✅ `test_macos_ble.sh` - Test script (ready)

## Testing

```bash
# Build for macOS
cargo build --features macos

# Run test
./test_macos_ble.sh

# Expected output:
# ⚠️ BLE advertising on macOS requires Peripheral role support
# ✅ macOS BLE adapter initialized (scanning-only mode)
```
