# PolliNet

PolliNet is an open-source SDK and runtime enabling **offline Solana transaction propagation** over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks. Inspired by biological pollination, transactions are created and signed offline, relayed opportunistically across devices, and submitted to Solana when any peer regains internet access.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Offline Transaction Relay**  
  Spread signed transactions like pollen grains via BLE mesh.

- **Nonce Account Support**  
  Extend transaction lifespan beyond recent blockhash constraints.

- **LZ4 Compression**  
  Efficient lossless compression of transaction payloads.

- **Fragmentation & Reassembly**  
  Split large transactions to fit BLE packet size limits.

- **Store & Forward**  
  Cache transactions when no gateway is available.

- **Confirmation Routing**  
  Deliver submission confirmations back to origin devices.
