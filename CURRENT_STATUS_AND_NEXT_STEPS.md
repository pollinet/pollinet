# PolliNet BLE Implementation - Current Status & Next Steps

## ✅ **What's Working Now**

###  1. **BLE Connection Detection** (FIXED!)
- ✅ Receiver connects to sender
- ✅ **Sender now detects the inbound connection** (was the bug)
- ✅ BLE state cleanup on startup (`sdk.reset_ble()`)
- ✅ Bidirectional connection establishment

**Fix Applied**: Updated `connected_clients_count()` in `src/ble/linux.rs` to detect both outbound AND inbound connections by checking discovered devices' connection status.

### 2. **BLE Discovery & Advertising**
- ✅ Devices advertise with PolliNet service UUID
- ✅ Devices discover each other
- ✅ Scanning and connection establishment works

### 3. **SDK Integration**
- ✅ All major functionality uses PolliNet SDK methods
- ✅ Transaction creation: `sdk.create_offline_transaction()`
- ✅ Fragment management: `sdk.fragment_transaction()`, `sdk.reassemble_fragments()`
- ✅ Transaction submission: `sdk.submit_offline_transaction()`

## ❌ **What's NOT Working**

### **Data Transmission via GATT**
**Problem**: No GATT characteristics for data exchange

**What You See in LightBlue**:
```
Service UUID: 7E2A9B1F-4B8C-4D93-BB19-2C4EAC4E12A7
Characteristics: (none)
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Devices can discover each other
- ✅ Devices can connect to each other  
- ❌ **Devices CANNOT write data** to each other (no writable characteristics)

**Current Workaround**: The code falls back to "broadcast mode" but this isn't reliable for point-to-point data transfer.

## 🧪 **Test the Connection Detection Fix**

Run both examples and verify the sender now detects the receiver:

### **Machine 1 (Sender)**:
```bash
cargo run --example offline_transaction_sender
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ BLE state reset - cleared all previous connections
📢 BLE advertising started fresh
🔍 Scanning started to detect receiver
⏳ Still waiting for receiver connection... (5s, 0 connected)
📊 Connected clients: 0 outbound, 1 inbound, 1 total  ← KEY LINE!
✅ Receiver has connected!
```

### **Machine 2 (Receiver)**:
```bash
cargo run --example offline_transaction_receiver
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ BLE state reset - cleared all previous connections
🔍 Discovery attempt #1/20
✅ Connected to sender: 90:65:84:5C:9B:2A
⏳ Waiting for transaction fragments...
```

## 🏗️ **Next Steps: Implement GATT Server**

To enable actual data transfer, we need to implement a **GATT Server** with custom characteristics.

### **Required Implementation**:

1. **Create PolliNet GATT Service** with characteristics:
   - **TX Characteristic** (UUID: `...12a8`) - Writable - Receives data from Central
   - **RX Characteristic** (UUID: `...12a9`) - Notify - Sends data to Central  
   - **Status Characteristic** (UUID: `...12aa`) - Readable - Connection status

2. **Integration Points**:
   - Start GATT server in `start_advertising()` (before advertising begins)
   - Handle writes to TX characteristic → trigger `receive_callback`
   - Handle RX notifications → send outgoing data

3. **Implementation Challenges**:
   - `bluer` 0.16 GATT API is different from examples
   - Need to understand correct characteristic control event patterns
   - Must handle async I/O for characteristic read/write/notify

### **Alternative Approaches** (if GATT is too complex):

#### **Option A: L2CAP Sockets**
- Direct socket connection between devices
- Bypass GATT entirely
- Lower-level BLE communication
- More complex but potentially simpler than GATT server

#### **Option B: Use Standard GATT Profiles**
- Nordic UART Service (NUS)
- Already implemented in many BLE stacks
- Well-documented and tested

#### **Option C: Hybrid Mode**
- BLE for discovery only
- Fall back to WiFi Direct or local sockets for data
- Good for testing transaction flow

## 📝 **Files Modified**

### **src/ble/linux.rs**
- Enhanced `connected_clients_count()` to detect inbound connections
- Added PolliNet service UUID filtering
- Improved GATT service discovery delays

### **examples/offline_transaction_sender.rs**
- Changed from active discovery to passive waiting
- Added `sdk.reset_ble()` for clean state
- Added connection status logging

### **examples/offline_transaction_receiver.rs**
- Added `sdk.reset_ble()` for clean state
- Improved fragment handling with SDK methods

### **src/lib.rs**
- Added `reset_ble()` method
- Added fragment access methods
- Improved relay_transaction with GATT fallback

### **src/ble/bridge.rs**
- Added `stop_advertising()` method
- Added fragment cache access methods

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Items**

1. **TEST** the connection detection fix (both machines should see connection)
2. **VERIFY** logs show "1 inbound" connection on sender
3. **CONFIRM** receiver waits for data (won't receive it yet, that's expected)

## 🔮 **Future Work**

1. **Implement GATT Server** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Research bluer 0.16 examples
   - Implement characteristic handlers
   - Test data write/read operations

2. **Add MTU Negotiation**
   - Handle large data packets
   - Fragment if needed for small MTU

3. **Error Handling**
   - Retry failed writes
   - Connection timeout handling
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduce GATT service resolution delays
   - Cache characteristic handles
   - Batch fragment transmissions

**Status**: ✅ Connection detection works, ❌ Data transfer blocked by missing GATT server
**Next Goal**: Implement GATT server with writable TX characteristic
**Timeline**: GATT implementation ~4-8 hours depending on bluer API complexity
