# GATT Server Implementation Plan for PolliNet

## 🎯 **Current Status**

**Connection Detection**: ✅ **FIXED** - Sender now detects when receiver connects
**Data Transmission**: ❌ **BLOCKED** - No GATT characteristics for data write

## 🔍 **The Problem**

When viewing a PolliNet device in LightBlue (BLE scanner app), you see:
- ✅ Service UUID: `7E2A9B1F-4B8C-4D93-BB19-2C4EAC4E12A7`
- ✅ Device is connectable
- ❌ **NO characteristics** - empty service!

This means:
1. Devices can **discover** each other ✅
2. Devices can **connect** to each other ✅  
3. Devices **CANNOT exchange data** ❌ (no writable characteristics)

## 🏗️ **What Needs to be Built**

A **GATT Server** with custom characteristics for bidirectional data transfer:
