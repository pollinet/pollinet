# 🔍 Issue Found: BLE MTU Limitation

## 🐛 **The Problem**

Your logs show:
```
📨 Received GATT notification: 4 bytes
📝 Received text message: $(
```

**Expected**: ~1116 bytes (full fragment)
**Actual**: 4 bytes  

## 🎯 **Root Cause: BLE MTU**

BLE has a Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) limit:
- **Default MTU**: 23 bytes (20 bytes usable data + 3 bytes overhead)
- **Your data**: 1116 bytes
- **Result**: Only first notification chunk received (4 bytes)

## ✅ **Solutions**

### **Solution 1: MTU Negotiation** (Recommended)

Request larger MTU before sending data:

```rust
// In write_to_device, before writing:
let mtu = device.request_mtu(512).await?;
tracing::info!("📏 Negotiated MTU: {} bytes", mtu);

// Then chunk data based on MTU
let chunk_size = (mtu - 3) as usize; // -3 for BLE overhead
for chunk in data.chunks(chunk_size) {
    characteristic.write(chunk).await?;
}
```

### **Solution 2: Use Broadcast Mode** (Current Workaround)

The broadcast mode doesn't have this MTU limitation because it uses a different mechanism.

**Why your test shows this**:
- GATT write → MTU limited → Only 4 bytes received
- Broadcast mode → Not MTU limited → Full data sent

### **Solution 3: Already Implemented!**

Your code ALREADY falls back to broadcast mode when GATT write fails!

The issue is that GATT write is "succeeding" (no error) but only sending 4 bytes, so it doesn't fall back.

## 🔧 **Quick Fix**

Update the GATT write to detect incomplete transmission and fall back:

```rust
// Track bytes written
let mut total_written = 0;

for fragment in &fragments {
    let data = serde_json::to_vec(&fragment)?;
    let data_len = data.len();
    
    match self.ble_bridge.write_to_device(peer_address, &data).await {
        Ok(bytes_written) => {
            total_written += bytes_written;
            if bytes_written < data_len {
                // Incomplete write, fall back to broadcast
                write_succeeded = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        Err(e) => {
            write_succeeded = false;
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

## 🚀 **Immediate Action**

The **broadcast mode already works**, so let's force it to be used instead of GATT write.

Modify `src/lib.rs` to skip GATT write for now:

```rust
// In relay_transaction():
let connected_peer = self.connected_peer.read().await;

// TEMPORARY: Skip GATT write due to MTU issues, use broadcast directly
if true { // Change to: if connected_peer.is_none() {
    tracing::info!("📤 Using broadcast mode for fragment transmission");
    return Ok(self.ble_bridge.send_fragments(fragments).await?);
}
```

This will make it use broadcast mode which doesn't have MTU limitations!

## 📊 **Test Results**

After forcing broadcast mode, you should see:
```
📤 Using broadcast mode for fragment transmission
📤 Broadcasting packet via BLE (1116 bytes)
📥 Received GATT notification: 1116 bytes  ← Full data!
✅ Fragment 1/1 received
✅ Transaction reassembled
```
